# Bubblesort-Algorithm-Using-C-Sharp
An example of a Bubblesort algorithm written in C Sharp.

This algorithm compares pairs of numbers and compares their size. If the first number in the order is greater than the second number they are swapped (by use of a temporary placeholder variable to represent the second number). The algorithm then performs this for each pair of numbers and continues until the array is in ascending order of size.
